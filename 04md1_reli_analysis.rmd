### Reliability analysis

```{r include = FALSE}
reli.data<-read.csv(file = "data/md1_reli_data_vienna.csv")
view(dfSummary(reli.data))
cohen.kappa(cbind(reli.data$response_orig,reli.data$response_reli))
```
A second rater naïve to the hypotheses and theoretical background of the study scored the data of 18 randomly selected dogs (ca. 30% of the preregistered sample). We used Cohen’s kappa to assess the interobserver reliability of the binary response variable “correct choice”. The two raters were in complete agreement (Κ=1, N=360).
